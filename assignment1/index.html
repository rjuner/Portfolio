			<p>Hi there, it's Rhea Rivera! I'm a gemini born in the year of the dragon, but really, who can trust the stars? </p>

			<p>My tagline is: Video production hands, tech head, art school heart. I've been in love with technology since I was a wee babe, I'm an art school dropout who went to Film school.</p>

			<p>I want to be successful at all the things, but for right now I'm focusing on becoming a Full Stack Web Developer (Thanks, UT Coding Bootcamp!)</p>

			<p>If someone is giving you a hard time about wanting to be a "Jack of All Trades" tell them this is the full quote and walk away smugly:</p>
				
			<p>"A jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one".</p>

			<p>Have a look around on my site and thanks for visiting! </p>
